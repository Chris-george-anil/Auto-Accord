A ML based Car sales website. 
In this project I have implemented a machine learning model that runs in the browser using Tensorflow.js.
We have implemented a Machine learning model in the car selling module.The Machine Learning model is used to find the approximate value of the car that is being put up for sale by the user.For this the user has to enter the required details of the car.Using the details the ML model will estimate the cos of the car. The technology used by us on the IWP point of view are HTML,JAVASCRIPT,CSS,TENSORFLOW.JS,NODE.JS
